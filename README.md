# Java-Typing-Tutor
Old Project from beginning at uni that required us to create a typing tutor program using Java Swing to create a GUI. 
Have plans on rebuilding this in HTML / Javascript in the future for a web app using more appropriate coding methods.

Attached is a picture of what the output was on submission. The program may not compile in current state due to depreciated libraries.

## What it does
The program works by pulling words from a repo and displays it onto the screen. The objective of the user is to attempt to type as many words as possible in the allocated time.
Words that are spelled correctly will highlighted green and the incorrect letters will be highlighted red. The user will have to go back and correct the
mistyped words before continueing. As the user types on their real keyboard, the keys in the interface will slightly change colors and form a border to show a depreciated press.
This allows the user more control of looking at the screen without the need of looking down.

After the time has expired, the percent of characters that were correctly typed will be displayed in a pop up. 

## Future additions
Instead of using a word bank in a .CSV file, the program will request words from either a 3rd party API or a created database.
Restructure the codebase. The files that were constructed was at the beginning of my time at FPU. At that time I had limited experience with OOP coding.
Recreate the project using HTML, Javascript, mySQL & possibly PHP to develop a web app rather than a standalone Java program.
